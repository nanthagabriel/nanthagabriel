# 🙋🏾‍♂️ Hi, I’m Nantha Gabriel.

From Indie films to Netflix features, I’ve spent decades telling stories. I dropped out of school at 13, but that has never stopped me from learning. Now at 43, I’m telling a different kind of story, this time with data. Today, I’m diving headfirst into Data Science, Machine Learning and AI.

My journey is one of growth and resilience, fueled by the same passion for storytelling I honed in my films. This repository is my roadmap to becoming a **Data Storyteller**, using data to craft compelling narratives that captivate and more importantly to inform.

The people around me say it’s a long shot, but hey, I’m the one taking aim and if there’s one thing the film industry has taught me, it’s perseverance. **I don't need luck, I have algorithms.** 

Check out my [learning-projects](https://github.com/nanthagabriel/learning-projects) here. I’ll be updating my projects and practices as I learn along the way and progress toward my goal.

### 🎬 Fun Fact!

Before diving into data science, I spent years in the film industry, acting in Netflix features and earning recognition at film festivals. The storytelling and problem-solving skills I developed, along with the resilience built through countless audition rejections, now shape my approach to data science. 

I bring a creative, narrative-driven mindset to everything I build and analyze. I embrace failure as part of the process, knowing each setback is just a step closer to success.
