# üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hi, I‚Äôm Nantha Gabriel.

From Indie to Netflix, I‚Äôve spent decades telling stories. I dropped out at 13, but never stopped learning. Now at 43, I‚Äôm telling a different kind of story, this time with data. Today, I‚Äôm diving headfirst into computer science 

I am learning something new everyday and i'm excited see what's ahead. I Feel like the last caveman who thinks he discovered fire.
My journey is one of growth and resilience, fueled by a dark past with no pun to the dramatics. 

This repository is my roadmap to becoming a **Storyteller**, using data to craft narratives that captivate and more importantly to inform.

The people around me say it‚Äôs a long shot, but hey, I‚Äôm the one taking aim and if there‚Äôs one thing the film industry has taught me, it‚Äôs perseverance. **I don't need luck when can I have algorithms.**

I‚Äôll be updating progress and my practices here.
