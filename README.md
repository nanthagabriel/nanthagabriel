# YEAR 2025

🙋🏾‍♂️ Hello! My name is Nantha Gabriel, an aspiring Data Scientist transitioning from a career in acting, with movies featured on Netflix. After leaving school at 13, I've spent years honing my craft in film. 
At 43 now, I’m pursuing a career change into Data Science. 

This GitHub repo tracks my journey as I self-teach myself Python, Machine Learning, AI and more. 
Each project here represents a milestone in my learning. 
I aim to build a strong foundation in tech and eventually pursue a fulfilling career in data science.

🎬 Fun Fact! 
While I’m transitioning to Data Science, I’ve acted in a whole lot movies, big and small. Some of which are streaming on Netflix and i've received my share of FilmFestival awards. I’m excited to take the skills I’ve developed in storytelling, problem-solving and even the aspects of Actor into the world of tech. 
Let’s innovate together!
